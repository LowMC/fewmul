Cryptographic primitives realized with few multiplications can significantly improve (or even enable!) applications in areas as diverse as homomorphic encryption, side-channel attack countermeasures, secure multiparty computation, or zero-knowledge proofs.

This one-time workshop aims to provide an overview of results, applications and current research in this area. This covers theory, design and analysis, as well as implementations. Major goals are to bring together researchers from the unusual set of relevant disciplines within cryptography/security and outside (e.g. circuit complexity), and to identify open problems and more applications.
